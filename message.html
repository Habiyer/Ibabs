                First of all, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!heheheðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‚ I just wanna take this chance to tell you how much you mean to me. You have no idea how grateful I am to have you in my life. Every single day, you make me happy in ways I never thought possible(kahit madalas wala kang paramdam hahahhahhaha). Your love, patience, and understanding mean everything to me, and I honestly donâ€™t know what I did to deserve someone as amazing as you.(Okay na ba ito sa boyfriend attitude na gusto mo babs? hahahhahah)<br>
                
                I know I can be moody sometimes, and I just wanna say sorry for those times when I act that way. I never mean to hurt you or make you feel bad. Itâ€™s just me being stupid sometimes, but please know that I appreciate you so much. Thank you for always being patient with me, for always understanding me even when I donâ€™t make sense.<br>
                
                Youâ€™re my happiness, my safe place, my best blessing. I love you so much, Babs, and I hope today brings you all the love and happiness you deserve. Letâ€™s make more memories together and keep growing in love mwa mwa.<br><br>
                
                Happy Birthday,Babi! I love you forever! mwa mwa chupchup ðŸ’–
